## 📌 Project Summary
CareFinder is a web-based platform designed to help users across Canada locate healthcare facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, and ambulatory health services, with ease. The platform features an interactive map, search and filter options, detailed facility profiles, and an adaptive interface with dark mode for improved accessibility.

CareFinder is tailored to address the needs of Canadian residents, immigrants, healthcare professionals, caregivers, and tourists by offering a dedicated tool for finding healthcare services. With CareFinder, users can efficiently filter facilities by type and specialized services, ensuring better access to healthcare information.
